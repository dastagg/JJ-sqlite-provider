# provider_routes

A Flutter tutorial by Johan Jurrius

## Description:

This tutorial will combine the Routes tutorial and the Provider tutorial.

In the Routes tutorial, the routes module was also used to pass data back and forth.

By combining Routes and Provider, the routes module will only handle routes and the Provider package will handle data distribution.
